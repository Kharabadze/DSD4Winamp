	DSD4Winamp
	(DSD Plugin for Winamp)
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	DSD (Direct Stream Digital) is a modern format
of sound data which is used in SACD (Super Audio CD).
So DSD is a modern replacement of PCM for sound representation.
Files from SACD can be recorded in two different formats:
DSF (Sony) and DFF (Philips).
	DSD4Winamp can decode both of thees formats.
Just copy "in_dsd.dll" to the folder 
	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Winamp\Plugins"
Re-run Winamp and you can listen your favorite songs from
DSF or DFF files.
